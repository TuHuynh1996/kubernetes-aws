# Getting Started

## Build, compiled and run
* Before build we need to generate openapi source with cmd:
    ```shell
        ./gradlew openApiGenerate
    ```
* Gradle build command:
    ```shell
        ./gradlew clean build
    ```
* We need to turn on Docker to SpringBoot start Dockercompose file when it run.


* Gradle run command:
    ```shell
        ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
